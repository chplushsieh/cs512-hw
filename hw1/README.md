Warning

I changed line 32183 of dblp_4area/paper.txt from:

32183	"Boosting'' a Positive-...

to:

32183	"Boosting" a Positive-...

because python csv reader can't parse a single unpaird double quote properly.

Usage

0. Put the data into a folder named 'dblp_4area/'.
1. Run pathsim.py to see the results for Q4(1) on console output.
2. Run p_pagerank.py to see the results for Q4(2) on console output.
